# Simon Pr√©gent

My personal site, where I showcase stuff I've made and maybe even post a rant now and again.

** This site is based on [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** a two column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering GitHub hosted blogs.

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Support for Disqus Comments
